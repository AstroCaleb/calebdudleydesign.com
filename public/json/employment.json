      "My focus is on developing, enhancing, and maintaining Contrast's user interface. I help contribute to ongoing efforts to build new applications and experiences within the Contrast platform. I also work with UX and Product to refine requirements for reusable components, styles, and patterns that we develop for our in-house design system.",
      "Recently, I architected and developed the foundation of the UI for our new Application Detection and Response (ADR) offering called <a href='https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/contrast-northstar-future-of-appsec/' aria-label='Contrast Northstar' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Northstar</a>, a unified platform that can detect, respond to, and fix application-layer attacks and vulnerabilities. I built this using the latest web technologies, including TypeScript, React, React Router, and React Query, along with custom/handwritten CSS taking advantage of features like container and media queries, nested selectors, and of course CSS variables."
