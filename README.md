### Welcome üññ

This is the code behind my personal portfolio site, which I recently made public to offer as another item in my portfolio (public repo is a duplicate of the private repo, but sorry, no old commit history to snoop through).

I built it to showcase my work, experiments, and ongoing projects. Feel free to explore the code, check out the site itself, or reach out if you‚Äôd like to connect or collaborate!

## Want to run this locally?

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AstroCaleb/calebdudleydesign.com.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies and run locally:
   ```bash
   yarn install && yarn dev
   ```
3. ‚òïÔ∏è
